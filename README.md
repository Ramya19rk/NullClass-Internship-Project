# NullClass-Internship-Project

# Problem Statement

The primary objective of my internship was to create data visualizations that provide insightful and actionable information based on specific filters and conditions. These visualizations were aimed at improving decision-making processes within the company by highlighting critical data points and trends.

# Overview of My Internship

During my internship at NullClass, I focused on developing advanced data analysis and visualization skills. The tasks involved manipulating large datasets, cleaning and preprocessing data, and creating interactive visualizations using Tableau and Python. The experience provided hands-on practice with real-world data challenges and enhanced my proficiency in various data science tools and techniques.

# Tableau Dashboard

One of the key deliverables of my internship was the creation of a Tableau dashboard. This dashboard was designed to present data in a visually appealing and easily interpretable manner. The main features and challenges of the Tableau dashboard included:

## Real-Time Charts: 

I faced the challenge of setting up real-time charts that would display data accurately based on specific time constraints. This required creating calculated fields to control the visibility of charts during particular hours.

## Filtered Visualizations: 

The dashboard included various charts filtered based on conditions such as company size, job title, experience, country, salary, work type, preference, and job application sources. These filters allowed users to drill down into the data and gain insights relevant to their specific needs.

## Interactive Elements: 

To enhance user engagement, the dashboard featured interactive elements such as clickable latitude and longitude coordinates that opened maps showing exact locations. This provided a dynamic way to explore geographical data.

## Color Coding: 

The dashboard utilized color coding to distinguish between different categories of data. For instance, details from India were displayed in orange, while details from Germany were shown in green. This color scheme dynamically swapped based on the time of day, adding an additional layer of interactivity and visual appeal.

## Time-Based Visibility: 

One of the most challenging aspects was ensuring that certain charts were only visible during specific times of the day (e.g., 3 PM to 6 PM). By using calculated fields, I was able to control the display of these charts, ensuring they met the required visibility criteria.

The Tableau dashboard ultimately served as a powerful tool for visualizing complex data sets, providing valuable insights, and supporting data-driven decision-making within the company.
